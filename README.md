# Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics 2020 Case Competition
_Josh K., Greesham S., Kristiyan D._ 

According to the American Hospital Association, each year there are 3.6 million Americans who do not get the medical care they need because of a transportation issue. The results: missed doctor appointments, missed diagnoses, increased healthcare costs and an overall less healthy society.

We ask ourselves, what is the role of health insurance companies to help alleviate transportation barriers that have such detrimental effects? Aiming to answer this question, we have conducted a thorough analysis of a Medicare patients dataset provided by Humana, and have built a model to better predict the presence of a transportation barrier for an individual. 

Based on our interpretation of the model output, we have determined several immediate solutions that Humana can implement to alleviate this particular social determinant of health for many of its members.
